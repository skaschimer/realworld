All backend implementations need to adhere to our [API spec](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/specs/api). The full API is described in the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/blob/main/specs/api/openapi.yml).

For your convenience, we have a [Hurl collection](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/specs/api/hurl) that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app. You can run them all with [`run-api-tests-hurl.sh`](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/blob/main/specs/api/run-api-tests-hurl.sh).

Check out our [starter kit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit) to create a new implementation, please read [references to the API specs & testing](/specifications/backend/introduction) required for creating a new backend.
