For your convenience, we have a [Bruno collection](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/specs/api/bruno) that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app. You can run them all with [`run-api-tests-bruno.sh`](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/blob/main/specs/api/run-api-tests-bruno.sh), or open the `bruno/` folder in the [Bruno app](https://www.usebruno.com) to run requests interactively.

The Bruno collection is automatically generated from the [Hurl test suite](/specifications/backend/hurl), which is the source of truth. It is kept in sync via CI.

## Running API tests locally

To locally run the provided Bruno collection against your backend, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/specs/api).
