For your convenience, we have a [Hurl collection](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/api/hurl) that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app. You can run them all with [`run-api-tests-hurl.sh`](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/blob/main/api/run-api-tests-hurl.sh).

## Running API tests locally

To locally run the provided Hurl collection against your backend, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/realworld-apps/realworld/tree/main/api).
